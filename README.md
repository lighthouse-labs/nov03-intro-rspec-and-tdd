Here's how we started:

1. empty folder
2. went into the folder
3. `bundle init`
4. Modify Gemfile (generated by init) to include `gem 'rspec'`
5. Run `bundle install` (install the gem's "latest stable version" for this project, which happens to be 3.3.0)
6. run `bundle exec rspec --init`
7. That creates the spec folder and 2 files
8. Take a look at them but don't get too caught up in all the things that spec_helper.rb has in it
9. Created a user_spec file that requires the lib/user file
10. Ran it using `bundle exec rspec spec/user_spec.rb`
11. Defined the lib/user file
12. And iterated beyond that

See code for end result of our iterative TDD approach.

**Important**: There are some points I didn't get to but I've left them there for your reference!
